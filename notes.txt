1. pull gtfs (gtfsr::import_gtfs) *done*

2. validate (gtfsr::import_gtfs) *done*

3. turn into an object (gtfsr::import_gtfs) *done*

4. filter as an object for the day (hansthompson/gtfsdrilldown) *done*

5. take in gps points and make tidy. Have lat, lon, and route. (to build: pull_gps_points)

6. Determine what trip ids from gtfs data and time of day and gps points. (to build: determine_trip_ids)

7. calculate delays (to build: calculate_delays)

8. build protocol buffer (to build: build_protobuf, with help from hansthompson/realtime-bus-api) 

Sooo.... 

	I need to calculate delays given gps points and trip_ids

	I need to calculate delays given the results from determining trip_ids and positions. 

	I need to determine what tidy data looks like for delay information: trip_id, sequence, delay

	I need to build a function that will build the protocol buffer for starters, just the tidy delay information.
